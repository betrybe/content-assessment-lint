# General guideline

## Time Estimation

### Think wisely on how the content of your page will fit the time the students will have to consume it.

Your page must fit into about 5 hours of content.

---

## Text density

### For each section you describe, try to write from one to three paragraphs of text.

Respect the context, scope and _break the rules when applicable_ ;).

---

## Voice tone

### Remember the course content is the backbone for students learning process.

Use a **first person** approach, informal language, but avoid too many slangs.

Remember you are talking directly to the students, you must **use the same language** as them.

Emojis are welcome! 🤙🏼

## Gender neutral language

### Why is it important?

Gender neutral language is a way to communicate without using male or female words to refer people.
Even when you use both (male and female words) you do not refer all the people, because there are people that do not recognize themselves as male or female gender.

### How to adopt gender neutral language

It is difficulty to adopt in the Portuguese language, sometimes we do not have neutral alternatives, for example, third person pronoun: eles, elas.
But there are some tips that help us to use gender neutral language in the content.

1. Avoid using articles in nouns that you can use in male and female forms:

> Os líderes da empresa -> Líderes da empresa (or As pessoas líderes da empresa)
> Os participantes do evento -> Participantes do evento (or As pessoas participantes do evento)

2. For nouns that vary by gender use "pessoas":

> Alunos -> Pessoas que estudam
> Desenvolvedores -> Pessoas desenvolvedoras/que desenvolvem
> Funcionários -> Pessoas que trabalham na empresa
> Executivos -> Pessoas executivas/em posições executivas

3. For group of people, try alternative forms:

> Os alunos da Trybe ->  As pessoas que estudam na Trybe
> Os monitores -> A monitoria
> Os diretores -> A diretoria
> Os coordenadores -> A coordenação
> Os deputados -> A Câmara
> Nossos clientes -> Clientes da empresa

4. For who is reading the text:

> Você está pronto? -> Você é uma pessoa preparada?
> Ficou interessado? -> Tem interesse?/Interessou-se?
> Mantenha-se atualizado -> Continue se atualizando

### Why not use "x" or "@"?

"X" and "@" are not pronounced. So, it is not accessible for visual impairment people.
